The project aims to streamline user and group management within Azure Active Directory (AD), focusing on tasks such as creating and configuring users, establishing groups with assigned and dynamic memberships, handling guest users, and ensuring proper resource access for all users.

**Project Tasks:**

**Create and Configure Azure AD Users:**

This task involves setting up user accounts within Azure AD, including defining user attributes, permissions, and access levels as per organizational requirements.

**Create Azure AD Groups with Assigned and Dynamic Membership:**

Group creation within Azure AD is crucial for efficiently managing users and their access permissions. This task involves creating groups and configuring both assigned and dynamic membership rules to ensure users are appropriately grouped based on roles, departments, or other criteria.

**Manage Azure AD Guest Users:**

Guest users play a vital role in collaboration and external partnerships. This task involves managing guest user accounts within Azure AD, including inviting, granting access permissions, and monitoring their activities.

**Grant Azure AD Guest Users Access to Resources:**

Ensuring that Azure AD guest users have appropriate access to resources within an Azure subscription is crucial for enabling collaboration and external engagement. This task involves granting access permissions to guest users based on specific resource requirements.

**Clean Up Resources:**

Proper resource management is essential to maintain the efficiency and security of the Azure environment. This task involves identifying and removing any unnecessary or obsolete resources to optimize usage and reduce potential security risks.
Project Outcome:

By successfully completing the tasks outlined in this project, the Azure AD user and group management process will be streamlined, ensuring efficient user provisioning, access control, and resource management within the Azure environment. Additionally, the project aims to enhance collaboration and security by effectively managing guest user access and maintaining a clean and organized resource infrastructure.
